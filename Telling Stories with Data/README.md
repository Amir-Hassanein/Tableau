## Project Introduction

* In this project, you’ll have the opportunity to combine a lot of what you’ve learned throughout this entire program. This project may seem challenging, and there isn’t a lot of guidance provided, as we want you to have the freedom to be creative. That dataset that you are working with is real, and it is pretty big. When you are an analyst for a company, there often isn’t guidance on how to correctly answer a particular question. And there might not really be one right answer. Leverage your skills. Make sure you look through the directions carefully.

## Project Description

* Your goal in this project is to create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. You will create data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.
